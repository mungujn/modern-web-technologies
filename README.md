## Abstract
Uganda has the 37th highest maternal mortality rate in the world. The maternal mortality rate currently stands at 336 per 100,000 live births. The majority of these deaths are due to avoidable delayed medical intervention. Knowing as precisely as possible what a health centre will need to cater to pregnant mothers can greatly improve that ease and speed of providing medical care to pregnant women at health centres. We propose leveraging recent developments brought on by increasing mobile Internet usage to develop low cost solutions aimed at reducing delays in the delivery of medical care. To demonstrate the applicability and potential benefits of such technologies we developed an application, built using progressive web application techniques. The application is capable of intelligently predicting the number of pregnant women likely to visit the health center in any given month, as well as the medical supplies and equipment that the facility will need to properly attend to them. Predictions will help facilities better plan resource deployment in order to provide timely medical treatment. Predictions can also improve the currently inadequate referral capabilities in many local health centres. The project takes advantage numerous currently available cloud computing solutions to demonstrate low cost deployment of our system
